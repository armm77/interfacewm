	* Fixed SEGFAULT on Linux upon startup


2003-09-24	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)

	* Added option parser
	* Use option parser in IWMController
	* Fixed ID for IWMDebug *cough*
	* Fixed screen detection in IWMWindowManager
	* Added some shape settings and a -destroy
	* Modified opening the display, closing the display now sets focus
	  back on the root window
	* Have IWMScreen check whether the theme is already set, instead of
	  looking at screenNumber


2003-09-07	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)

	* Have libraries install their headers in .../Headers/InterfaceWM/
	* New debug level "verbose", that is "all" without "trace"
	* Started rewriting the whole event handling, though #ifdef'd out
	  because the whole event handling requires quite a few changes...


2003-09-06	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)

	* Fixed -handleUnmapEvent: so that windows already map'd during
	  startup are remap'd and drawn
	* Added dead children zap to iwm_display_open()
	* Fixed and cleaned up iwm_populate_env_display()
	* Rewrote the main event-handler for a saner/saver event handling
	* Added a sample UserDefaults in misc/


2003-08-31	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)
	* Cleaned up IWMDebug
	  instead of several functions, use IWMLog(level, format, args)
	  Note: All functions are still available as macros.
		Unfortunately this means that you will need to use 'nil' as
		argument(s) even if no arguments are dumped, eg.
		  IWMNote(@"No event.", nil);
	* fixed problems regarding the clean-up
	* fixed error in IWMWindowManager+Event calling -cacheEventTime:
	* Cleaned up GNUmakefile.preamble
	* Created GNUmakefile.local for X11 config, as this may vary
	* Wrote README.install
	* Added misc/ containing
	  - a sample script correctly calling IWM via 'opentool interfacewm'
	  - a sample xinitrc using the sample script
	* Fixed call to -directoryExistsAtPath: in IWMTheme that threw an
	  exception, although the method exists... hmmmm
	* Renamed README to README.old and rewrote README


2003-08-18      Ian
        * remove obsolete IWMAtom files


2003-06-04	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)
	* use gcc's __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ in IWMTrace() and let gcc worry
	  about how the selector is actually built -- but even gcc
	  sometimes screws up, if a selector is, eg. --foo:b_ar:
	  you get [class foo:b:ar:] (OTOH you shouldn't use -a_b: anyway)
	* a couple of fixes of NULL -> 0
	* commented gcc3.3+ specific options in GNUmakefile.preamble,
	  compiles smoothly with gcc32


2003-05-04	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)
	* Fix a "bug" in IWMTrace() that would print "[class foobar:_]"
	  instead of "[class foobar::]" if the method is -foobar::


2003-04-30	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)
	* Quick workaround hack for putenv()
	* Hacked IWMTRACE to work on functions as well


2003-04-22	Chris (cbv@knuddel.org)
	* Modified GNUMakefile.preamble to assure clean compiling
	* Added IWMDebug.[h,m] for runtime "debugging"
	* Modified main() to allow --GNU-Debug=...
	* Added some IWMTRACE
	* Changed some debug fprintf/NSLog to IWMDebug()
	* Expanded X11 error handler to use IWMWarn() and print more info
	* Fixed minimize/maximize core dump
