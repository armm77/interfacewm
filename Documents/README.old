- the code is currently very broken and full of mess
- IWMClientDescriptor (which is currently non-functional) will be changing
in order to conform to EWMH
- don't count on this code.  it'll start, but you won't be able to pull up
a client.

                         Interface Window Manager
                 Ian Mondragon - < the.copal atgmaildotcom >
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Interface window manager was designed with the following goals in mind:

  1. Written in Objective-C, using the GNUstep (http://www.gnustep.org)
     libraries.

  2. Provide strictly minimal functionality, with all additional features 
     available via bundles (called IWMComponents).

  3. Utilize the GNUstep defaults database for user settings, such as
     mouse button configuration, key bindings, and initial color settings.

  4. Be optimized for use in a strictly GNUstep environment.

                             Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Install GNUstep (www.gnustep.org)
    
  - Make sure you have libwraster installed

  - Compile Interface by running "make install" - this will, by default,
    install the executable in $GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT as a tool named
    "interfacewm"

    (NOTE: if you are running a *BSD system, you will most likely need to
     run "gmake install")

  - Place the Defaults.themed directory in the following directory:
  
                ~/GNUstep/Library/InterfaceWM/Themes/

  - modify your ~/.xinitrc to point to interfacewm:

                opentool interfacewm
