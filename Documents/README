  This is version 0.2.4 of Interface WM (IWM)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overview
========

  The Interface window manager was designed with the following goals in
  mind:

    1. Written in Objective-C, using the GNUstep (http://www.gnustep.org)
       libraries.

    2. Provide strictly minimal functionality, with all additional features
       available via bundles (called IWMComponents).

    3. Utilize the GNUstep defaults database for user settings, such as
       mouse button configuration, key bindings, and initial color settings.

    4. Be optimized for use in a strictly GNUstep environment.


Status
======

  - the code is currently very broken and full of mess
  - IWMClientDescriptor (which is currently non-functional) will be changing
    in order to conform to EWMH
  - don't count on this code.  it'll start, but you won't be able to pull up
    a client
